    //addeventlistener is better as it listens to keyboard events and drag and drop events as well
    //newer approach than onclick

    //the event we want to listen to is passed as the first argument, the third parameter is false and true, default is false

    //sometimes we need to pass false or true>
    //look at type, timestamp, defaultPrevented,  target, toElement, srcElement, currentTarget
    //clientX, clientY, screenX,screenY
    //altkey, ctrlKey, shiftKey, keyCode

    
    //event propogation
    //event bubbling and event capturing, event bubbling is the default behaviour goes from child to parent and event capturing is 
    //from parent to child

    document.getElementById("images").addEventListener("click", function(event)
    {
        console.log("You clicked on the images list!");
    }, false); //true for capturing, false for bubbling
    //right now we are targeting capturing what happens is that the parent(images run) and then the child(owl) runs
    //if we change the third parameter to false, then the child runs first and then the parent runs

    document.getElementById("google").addEventListener("click", function(event)
    {
        event.preventDefault(); //this will prevent the default action of the link, which is to navigate to the link
        console.log("You clicked on the Google link!");

        //preventDefault() is used to prevent the default action of the event, eg stopping a form before it is submittied
        //preventing a redirection to a url
        //event.stopPropagation(); //this will stop the event from bubbling up to the parent elements
        //stopPropagation() is used to stop the event from bubbling up to the parent elements, it will not prevent the default action

                event.target.parentNode.remove();     //the issue was that google was an li element so when we clicked on that
                //we got ul as the parent element and then the parent element was being removed
                //which resulted in everything being removed    
            }
            //this will remove the parent element of the clicked image from the DOM
            //removes the li as well the issue with that I was doing was that the child (image) was being removed but the parent (li) was not being removed
        })
    })
    //this is how we can remove an element from the DOM using the event object
    //using event.target.remove() removes the target element from the DOM
    //here we used click so wherever we clicked on the image that became the target
    //and then calling event.target.remove() removes the target element from the DOM
